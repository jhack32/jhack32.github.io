## Questions

- What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I've learned a lot about padding, borders, margins. The margin is the outer layer. Then the border, and after the border is the padding. I've learned how to use each one (padding, borders, margin). I was able to create horizontal lines by using border.


- What did you learn about CSS positioning?

It's important to keep in mind the percentages you've used previously. I've learned that using inline-blocks is helpful for small screens.

- What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I have a pretty simple design. It was very simple to implement. It's a simple boxed column in the middle that shows a logo, navigation, content and social media icons/email.

- What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?




### Reflection

I enjoyed adding CSS to my website. I learned a lot during the process. It was difficult making the website viewable on mobile/tablet devices. I only had to make the icons in the footer fit onto the screen correctly but I definitely enjoyed doing it.
